__The set of abstract shapes supported by Hades.__

Each geometrical shape has
properties and behaviours that will be the same regardless of what it represents
in the diagram. These are encoded here to avoid duplication.

The one commonality that is not included here is the drawing method. This is
dependent on the underlying GUI library, and hence is kept in a parallel module
elsewhere.

Shapes covered here are:

* Ellipse

* Diamond: a parallelogram with corners top, bottom, left and right.

* A parallelogram with horizontal edges. This is defined by its
inner box (the rectangle where text can be drawn) rather than the outer bounding box.
This avoids a bunch of tricky edge cases with narrow parallelograms, including the
non-existent inner box and the negative base.

* Oval: a rectangle with rounded ends. Like the parallelogram this is defined by its inner box.

* Lines that connect boxes together.
