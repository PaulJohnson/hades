    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <h3>Opening PDFs with <code>file://</code> URLs in Adobe Acrobat</h3>
    <p>If you have Adobe Acrobat installed and use a <code>file://</code>
      URL to refer to a PDF document then clicking on the link button in
      a matrix will cause Acrobat to report an error with the file name
      instead of opening it. At present the only workarounds we can
      offer are to uninstall Acrobat, configure another program as the
      default for opening PDFs, or not use <code>file://</code> URLs
      with PDFs (other types of URL, such as <code>http://</code>, work
      fine).<br>
    </p>
    <p>This appears to be a conflict between Acrobat and the GLib open
      source library. We will investigate further and submit a bug
      report if appropriate.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Other Issues</h2>
    <p>If you encounter any other problems with using the DSM then
      please let us know. Email <a
        href="mailto:support@diametricsoftware.com">&lt;support@diametricsoftware.com&gt;
     </a>with:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>The version of the DSM you are using (look at the window title bar).</li>
        <li>The steps to reproduce the problem.</li>
        <li>The difference between what you expect and what actually happens.</li>
        <li>If the problem is associated with a particular file then it
      would be very helpful if you could provide a copy. If this
      requires an NDA then we will be happy to consider it.</li>
